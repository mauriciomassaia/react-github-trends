# Trending Repositories on Github

![./ss.jpg](./ss.jpg)

This project list of the repositories created in the last 7 days with the most number of stars in
github should be displayed and the user should be able to favourite them.

The favourited repositories should be visible either through a filter or in a different
tab. Some basic info about the repo should be displayed, such as: repo name, link
to GitHub, description and number of stars.
To keep things simple, the favourites won’t be sent back to GitHub’s servers but just
stored locally (e.g localstorage, cookies etc...).
